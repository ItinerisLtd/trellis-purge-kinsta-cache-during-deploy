## FAQs

### How do you purge Kinsta cache?

By invoking `wp kinsta cache purge` and `wp kinsta cache purge --object` during deploy.

### Why ignore errors?

Since v0.4.0, this role ignore errors for `wp kinsta cache purge` and `wp kinsta cache purge --object`. This is because those 2 commands trigger HTTP requests to `localhost` which might trigger `429 too many requests` errors.

Kinsta support refused to whitelist `localhost` requests from rate limits.

### Does it purge Kinsta CDN caches?

No.

> Unfortunately no, there is no way on clearing that [Kinsta CDN] cache through command line for now.
>
> There are internal discussions and our developers are working on finding a solution, but unfortunately at this point we do not have an ETA or if that will be available.
